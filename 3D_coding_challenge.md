Functional spec
---------------

Prototype the following project:

#### Create a 3D scene with a 3D object and apply texture and animation

Create a 3D scene and add a baseball bat object to it. Decorate the bat object by applying wooden texture to barrel and knob and tape texture to the grip. Add animation to show the bat pullback and swing action.

Use [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) for 3D implementation. The UI/UX for the application should be polished. Be creative in defining additional features as needed.
