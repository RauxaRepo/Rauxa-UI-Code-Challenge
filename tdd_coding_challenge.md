Test spec
---------------

Create a series of tests that validate the service created in the fe_coding_challenge. A successful effort will be judged on the completeness of code coverage. Both pass and fail states should be demonstrated. Consolidated test results should be easily viewable. If the fe_coding_challenge needs to be refactored to achieve satisfatory results, additional time may be granted. When finished, be prepard to explain the test rationale and patterns used in test design. Comments on best pratices, pitfalls or suggested refinements are positively considered. The finished test should be ready to be added to CI/CD pipelines. Be prepared to give guidance on the how this could be done. Technology selection is the up to the testee, but JavaScript frameworks like Mocha are preferred.
